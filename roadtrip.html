		<p> After leaving Minneapolis, I spent my first night on the road in the middle-of-no-where
		South Dakota. I must say that I was pretty  lonely, but more than that I was excited. 
		At this point I had been so fed up with how mundane my life had been that I knew I 
		needed a change. Also, I thoroughly enjoyed having some time to myself for thought. 
		I was so busy before that it seemed as though I never had time for myself and suddenly 
		I had more than I could ever ask for.</p>
		<p> I used to give the United States a lot of shit, acting as though I was somehow 
		better than it. This trip proved to me just how beautiful it is. So many different landscapes, 
		people, and environments all under one nation. During the first 2 days of driving I saw
		the beautiful transition from the endless flat of the Dakota to the dramatic peaks of 
		The Grand Tetons in Wyoming.</p> 
		<p>When I arrived in Jackson Hole I couldn't have been more excited. From what I had 
		heard about JH, it seemed like there would be a lot of like-minded people here. Young Folk
		who are open to anything, not finding their way as many twenty-somethings do. I met some
		very nice people in JH, who gave me more than I could ask for in terms of travel tips. They told me
		about cheap yet healthy meals, great places to stay, and the most beautiful places to visit. Best of
		all, though, were their stories. People from all of the country, and so many different 
		backgrounds all converged on this hidden gem in the middle of Wyoming. </p>

		<p> My next stop was Oregon, from there I would drive down the rest of the coast to
		California. I only had to drive through the night once, and on the one night I on the 
		road happened to be very nice so I decided to sleep in my car. My cousin lives out in Portland, 
		so when I got there I stayed with him. I spent a few days in Portland, seemed cool, but I was eager to see
		California.<p>
		<p>Once I arrived in California I knew that I wanted to stay. My brother lives out there
		so I knew that I could stay as long as I needed to. I wasn't sure how long I'd be here, but 
		I knew that when I left there's only one place I could go - Europe.</p>
