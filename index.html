			<h2> Who am I? </h2>
				<img src = "images/profilepicture.jpeg" alt = "me"/>
				<p> My name is Eoin, pronounced Owen. I come from an Irish family, which is 
				where the spelling comes from. I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, went to
				private school my entire life. While I appreciate my education, there's no
				doubt in my mind that it sheltered me from a lot of the outside world. It wasn't 
				until I got to college when I was exposed to so many new ways of thinking. I 
				quickly became skeptical of everything I was previously taught. While I was raised 
				Catholic, I now consider myself Agnostic, but I'm not even sure about that. 
				This same skepticism has led me to many new social beliefs. The society that I grew up
				on was extremely superficial, and since then I've definitely broadened my horizons. 
				Realizing that the way I lived was so mundane, I have become extremely curious about the
				the world around me and the lives that are lived within it. </p>
				
				<p>Other than that, I consider myself to be a pretty reserved person. I tend to keep only a few close
				 friends who are like family to me. I don't know
				what I'd do without them. I keep myself active with running daily, and skiing in 
				the winter. I'd say my absolute favorite hobby is photography. I take my camera with me 
				wherever I go. I rarely ever photograph myself, usually sticking to my surrounding or 
				the people that I'm with.

			<h2> What's <strong>my</strong> story? </h2>
				<p> So what brought me to where I am today? Why do I travel the world alone, 
				making only temporary relationships? I was mid-way through my senior year studying marketing
				at The University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. I had a great group of friends, 
				and I was honestly enjoying myself and my college experience very much. As I came
				to the mid-way point of my senior year reality hit me like a train. I realized I 
				only had 4 months left before I entered the "real world". I was always told my by 
				superiors to do the things that I want to do while I can, but I had yet to do any of 
				those things. With only 4 months and so much to do, I put my education on pause. I 
				decided to un-enroll in my classes and hit the road - literally. I packed up
				my hiking backpack, put things in the back of my truck and headed west. Just
				me and my camera, I've tried to document <strong>a</strong> journey. I say a journey
				rather than my journey because this story isn't about me, but rather the possibilities that
				anyone can take advantage of. 
				</p>
				<p>That was a year ago. I spent 3 weeks roadtripping around the united states.
				First across the midwest, then down the west coast. I documented the whole
				journey with my laptop and my camera.</em> </p>
			<h2> My Goal </h2>
				<p> It's simple: to inspire people to beyond the
				bubbles that they live in. </p>
				<p> The best way to learn is through experience and put push yourself outside of your
				comfort zone. I have found that people who have had the most experiences, met the
				widest variety of people, and who have seen the most places to be the most inspirational.
