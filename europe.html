		<h2>Barcelona</h2>
		<p> Barcelona, Spain was my first stop on my European adventure. Luckily, a friend 
		of mine form college was studying abroad here at the time, which made living pretty 
		easy. He lived in a small apartment with one roommate whom he'd been paired with on his program.
		While the apartment wasn't very nice, it was located right in the center of the city. 
		It seemed like everything was right where it needed to be.</P>
		<p>The nightlife in Barcelona was absolutely insane. Back at school, I'd stay out until 2:45AM
		at the absolute latest. On my first night we were at a club until 7:45AM, which is the time 
		I used to wake up for class. This was just what I needed to kick off my time in Europe. 
		The world these people live in was completely different from anything I had ever experienced, which
		is exactly what I was looking for.</p>
		<p> Barcelona made me realize that more people should live a more carefree lifestyle. 
		People there seemed to have deeper connections with one-another, which was something I was also looking
		for. Up until this point, I had made a few random friends on my journey, but nothing long lasting. </p>

		<h2>Paris</h2>
		<p>I had an absolute blast in Barcelona, but I couldn't have been more excited to experience
		Paris. This time around I didn't know anyone staying there, so I opted for a super cheap hostel.
		The hostel was surprisingly social and I was invited to go wander around the city. For my first 
		few days I did the usual touristy things that I felt obligated to do, which was fun, but
		nothing special. On my fourth night, of seven, I decided to go to a bar by myself just to see
		if I could put myself out there, I figured I only have one shot at making this trip the best
		that it can be. While out I met a girl named Bridget, who also happened to be from the states. 
		We immediately hit it off and ended up spending the last 3 days of my time in Paris with her. 
		We ate out, went dancing, spent hours in museums, and talked a lot about life. 
		We seem to always be on the same page in terms of being in no rush, and wanting to 
		live through experiences. I was super excited to meet Bridget, but unfortunately I had
		to leave Paris and head to London. We added each other on Facebook, so hopefully we can
		keep in touch. </p>

		<h2>London</h2>
		<p> There I was on the last leg of my journey and I couldn't be less ready for it to be over, 
		that being said I knew I had to make the most of my last 7 days. Here, once again, I was able to meet up
		with someone I knew from college. It was my friend Rory, who had graduated the previous spring and moved
		to London so that he could be with his boyfriend. Rory was the life of the party and I quickly got acquainted
		with many of his friends. They showed me everything London had to offer in what seemed to be an absolute whirlwind of a week</p>
		
		<p> On the third night we went to see one of their favorite EDM artists, Kygo, and a huge
		concert. I had always thought of EDM as a very stupid genre (to be honest), but I promised to 
		keep my mind open. I was offerend a "point of molly", an apparently very popular drug in Europe, 
		but I figured I'd stick to booze for the night. In the end, the Kygo concert was one of the 
		best shows I've ever been to, an absolute blast, and one of the highlights of my trip.</p>
		
		<p>Now, as I'm sitting in my bed, having just finished packing, I can't stop thinking about how
		not-ready I am to return to the states. This trip, along with my roadtrip to the west-coast 
		have given me a small taste of what the world has to offer, but I need more. My first task at hand
		when I get home will be to start looking into a trip throughout Asia or South America, whichever is more 
		affordable, so stay tuned!</p>.
		
		<p> I hope you guys enjoyed reading about my European adventure! Be sure to check out my other
		blog posts as well as my vlogs that are on my YouTube Channel!</p>
		
		<p> Never stop exploring.</p>
